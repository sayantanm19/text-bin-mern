# Text Bin MERN

An implementation similar to that of Pastebin and other text storage websites, using the MERN stack. Each paste can be customized with a title, custom short URL and the expiry time after which the paste would be automatically deleted form the database. The latest pastes tab shows all the pastes submitted previously.
